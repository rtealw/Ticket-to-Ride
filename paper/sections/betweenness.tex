\caption{Destination Tickets by their effective
resistance and minimum path length.
The line of best fit gives an approximation of the
Destination Tickets that are better than average (above the line)
and worse than average (below the line) in terms
of the point value per difficulty.
Note: the $16^{th}$ Destination Ticket Portland/Phoenix is obscured
by the $18^{th}$.}
