\section{Effective Resistance \& Destination Tickets}

resistance and minimum path length.
The line of best fit gives an approximation of the
Destination Tickets that are better deals (above the line).
Note: the $16^{th}$ Destination Ticket Portland/Phoenix is obscured
by the $18^{th}$.}

\subsection{Simulations}

\caption{The proportion of times that a player with a certain
Destination Ticket in their hand won.
The vertical red lines at $x=1/4$ and $x=1/2$ represent
the expected proportion of times a player with a certain Destination Ticket
would win if there was no affect. (Computed from 1000 simulations.)}

%The disparity between two and four player
%games originates from the different number
%of losers: most of the time there are three 
%losers in the four person game whereas there is 
%always only one loser in the two person game.
%(Games were simulated using
